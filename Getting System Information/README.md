# Getting System Information using Python
### Requirements:  
Basic knowledge of python(Learn Python Tutorial) . We can use any ide ( for example: https://code.visualstudio.com/download, https://jupyter.org/) .

### Modules required:
Platform:  Platform is an in-built module in Python. It is used to get any kind of information about the system or platform on which we are executing the program, currently. Not only the system information ,but it is also helpful to fetch information about our Python software running on the system.

### Installation:  
It comes with python installation, therefore we don’t need to install it.

### Approach for System Information:  
1. Firstly, we have to import the platform module.

2. Most importantly, to get information about our system we have to know the platform functions well. Let’s have a look of them:

A. **platform.system()** – displays the name of the operating system(for example – windows,linux).

B. **platform.version()** – displays the version of the operating system.

C. **platform.release()** – returns the OS Release.

D. **platform.machine()** – helps to know the machine type.

E. **platform.processor()** – displays the name of the processor.

F. **platform.node()** – returns the network name.

G. **platform.platform()** – allow us to know many useful information that is to retrievable about the system .
