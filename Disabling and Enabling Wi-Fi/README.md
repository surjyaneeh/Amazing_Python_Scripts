# Disabling and Enabling Wi-Fi
In this tutorial, we will see how we can use small and simple but interesting python scripts for enabling and disabling wi-fi option of our laptop or desktop.

So let’s get started right away.

## Disabling Wi-Fi Option Using Python
#### Requirements:
 Basic knowledge of python. We can use any ide ( for example: https://code.visualstudio.com/download, https://jupyter.org/)

#### Module :
Subprocess : The subprocess module present in python allows us to process the system-level scripts within the piece of python code. Subprocess module was introduced to replace many old modules/functions present in Python. This module has many methods(for example, subprocess.call(), subprocess.run(), subprocess.check_output(), subprocess.Popen() and communicate() functions) for running system level languages or scripts within python environments.

#### Installation:
It comes with python installation, therefore we don’t need to install it.

#### Approach for disabling wi-fi option :
1. Firstly, we have to import our subprocess module.
2. Secondly, we will call the run method.
3. Finally , we will execute the program to disable wi-fi.

## Enabling Wi-Fi Option Using Python
Requirements and the module are the same as we have while disabling wi-fi option.

#### Approach for enabling wi-fi option :
1. Firstly, we have to import our subprocess module.
 
2. Secondly, we will call the run method.

3. Finally , we will execute the program to enable wi-fi again.
